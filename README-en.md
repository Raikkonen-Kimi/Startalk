# Introduction
STARTALK is an open source IM system platform. It covers all the target platforms and target systems you can think of, excellent performance.

Startalk focuses on the application scenarios of toB.

The goal of Startalk is, to slove the problem that enterprises do not have a unified IM platform in the past 20 years:

```
In contrast, after more than 20 years of evolution in major operation systems,with the advent of nginx, deploying a set of http services has become very simple.
```


put it simply, the advantages of our system are very obvious:

```
1. Performance, stability and platform adaptability can be regarded as the best in the industry.
2. Supporting all platforms in theoretically.
3. Almost all the code is open sourced.
4. Pure communication software, covering most scenarios what you can think of.
```

The disadvantages are also:

```
1. The system is huge and complex
2. The technology stack involved is very wide. 
3. It cannot be fully grasped by personal.
```
